# goto

An Alternative build and package system for Go. Never deal with $GOPATH again. Take back your freedom to 
layout projects however you want. Stop hardcoding package URLs in source code. 

goto wraps the Go package system in a way that adds the following enhancements:

* Build multi-package projects in place, at any location, without setting $GOPATH
* Specify package URLs just once in a config file
* Import from any location in the filesystem
* Namespace package names based on subdirectory
* Alias package names
